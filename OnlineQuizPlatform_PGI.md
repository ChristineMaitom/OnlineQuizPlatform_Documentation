# Project General Information
               
## A. Problem Statement:
There is an increasing demand for effective and efficient ways of assessing knowledge and abilities in today’s educational environment. Traditional paper-based quizzes and tests take a long time to administer and mark, making it difficult for teachers and instructors to respond in a timely manner. Furthermore, these strategies are often rigid, making it difficult to accommodate learning preferences for distant students or different individuals. With the rise of digital learning, there is a need for an online quiz system that can automate the creation, management and grading of quizzes.

## B. Project Description:
Create an online quiz platform where users can host and create quizzes on a variety of topics. It is designed to simplify the process of creating, administering, and analyzing questionnaires for teachers, companies, and educators. The platform enables users to create cross-examination quizzes, create automated grades, and deliver real-time performance reviews. With a user-friendly interface and mobile accessibility, the system will improve participant engagement and learning experience.

## C. Project Objectives:

To develop a OnlineQuizPlatform APP that will help manage the quiz with the following features:
1.Automate Quiz Creation and Grading: Reduce manual effort by allowing educators to create quizzes easily and have them graded automatically.
2.Support Multiple Question Formats: Include various types of questions such as multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, and essay.
3.Feedback: Provide instant feedback to participants to enhance the learning experience.
4.Data Security: Ensure the security and privacy of user data.
5.Scalability: Handle a large number of users simultaneously without performance issues.
6.User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive interface that is easy to navigate for both quiz creators and participants.
